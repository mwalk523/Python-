"""
      How the for loop works:
      - Assigns creates a variable by the name of whatever is in the place of _ (in this case, students)
      - Assigns that variable to the first object in the list (in the case of range, this would be 0)
         - Range itself is a list
         - However, since this is still a list of strings, each number in the range corresponds to an entry
      - Then assigns the variable to the next thing in the list and then executes the indented code each time
